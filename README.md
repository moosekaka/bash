## Some shell scripts.
 * `smart.sh` lists several parameters from S.M.A.R.T for all the disks in a ZFS file server I have.
 * `install.bash` is for installing symlinks for my config files. I run [MSYS2](https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/Home/) on Windows 7 and 10 and this requires a little more care when setting up UNIX style symlinks in a Windows enviroment.
